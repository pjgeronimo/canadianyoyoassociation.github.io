      <h1>Patricia A. Whelan Performance Hall</h1>
      <p>
        Past the main entrance, the performance hall will be on your left-hand
        side. As you walk into the performance hall, you will see the audience
        seats that are placed in a slope and look down at the stage. The
        performance hall is equipped with over 300 seats and has enough spaces
        for tables with vendors and products.
