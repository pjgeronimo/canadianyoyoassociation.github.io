		<h1>Contest Rules</h1>

        <h3>Format</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You will submit a video showing your freestyle routine up to 2 minutes long.</li>
            <li>There will be 1A and Open (non-1A) divisions. No preliminary rounds for either division.</li>
            <li>You may choose your own music for your routine, as long as it is tested without copyright issues on YouTube. (<a href="copyright.html">How?</a>)</li>
            <li>Non-Canadian residents are welcome to compete for prizes!</li>
			<li>Top three Canadian residents (who are not already seeded) in each division will be seeded into the finals of Canadian Nationals 2024.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Video rules - Technical requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The video must clearly show your face.</li>
            <li>The video frame must be fixed against the background without any panning or zooming, either by camera movement or editing.</li>
            <li>The video must be in landscape orientation and at least 1920x1080 in resolution.</li>
            <li>The entire routine must be filmed in one take with no special effects including speed adjustments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Video rules - Judging requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Judging begins when music begins. For aesthetics you are allowed to have about 1 second in the video before the music begins,
            and about 1 second after your routine ends.
            <span class="emphasis">Your video cannot be longer than 2 minutes and 3 seconds, otherwise it will be trimmed
            right at the 2:03 mark.</span>
            <li>It is your responsibility to make sure the video clearly shows your tricks and choreography.
            Consider the lighting and colour combinations between your string, clothing, and surroundings.</li>
            <li>The video must not be visible publicly prior to the contest. While the routine can be the same as previous contests, the video itself
            must be newly filmed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Music rules</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Music must be free of copyright issues on YouTube. See <a href="copyright.html">this page</a> on how to check this.</li>

            <li>Upon <a href="register.html">registration</a> you will be asked to upload your video to YouTube unlisted
            showing that it is not blocked in any way. The music may have a copyright claim, but as long as it can be played without restrictions
            it is acceptable.</li>
            <li>You may consider using music from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary">Youtube's audio library</a>, but not required.</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="register-box">
            Video and music must be inclusive and appropriate for all ages.<br/>
            (e.g. slurs, obscenities, violence, hate speech, etc are strictly prohibited)<br/><br/>
            When in doubt, <a href="mailto:canadianyoyoassociation@gmail.com">consult the organizers directly</a>.
